# Why React?

## Composition.

## Declarative vs Imparative code. (Normal for vs map).

## Unidirectional data flow is used by Recat, resolving some complexity using data binding.

Data flow from the parent to child, data updates are sent to parent to perform the actual changes.

In React, data flows in only one direction, from parent to child. If data is shared between sibling child components, then the data should be stored in the parent component and passed to both of the child components that need it.

## React is just a "Java Script"

Not too much new syntax should be learned, just be good in JS.
